1. 🌟 **Workflow:**
    -  A Workflow is a set of automated processes that define how your code is built, tested, and deployed.
    -  It's defined in a YAML file stored in your repository's .github/workflows directory.
    -  Multiple workflows can exist in a single repository, each with its own triggers and jobs.

2. 👥 **Jobs:**
    - Jobs are the individual units of work within a Workflow.
    - They can run in parallel or sequentially, depending on your configuration.
    - Each job typically represents a specific task in your CI/CD pipeline, such as building, testing, or deploying.

3. 🚶‍♂️ **Steps:**
    - Steps are the individual actions or tasks performed within a job.
    - Each step is defined in the Workflow file and specifies an action or command to execute.
    -  Steps are executed sequentially within a job, and the success of one step often depends on the success of the previous step.

4. 🛠️ **Actions:**
    - Actions are reusable units of code that perform specific tasks.
    - They can be created by you or sourced from the GitHub Marketplace and the Actions community.
    - Actions can be used in Workflow files to define the steps and automate common processes.
